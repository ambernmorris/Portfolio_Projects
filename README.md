# Portfolio_Projects
This repository contains samples of my work using SQL, R, Python, and SAS. The data used in these projects are open-source and do not contain any identifying personal information. 
These are mostly independent projects with limited oversight and collaboration from colleagues. 
Please feel free to reach out to me at ambermorris@berkeley.edu with any questions or requests.
