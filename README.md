# Portfolio_Projects
This repository contains samples of my work using SQL, R, Python, and SAS. These data used in these projects are open-source and contain no identifying personal information.
These are mostly independent projects with limited oversight + collaboration from colleagues. 
Please reach out to me at ambermorris@berkeley.edu with any questions or requests.
