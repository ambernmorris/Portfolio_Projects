SAS sample work available upon request for job applications (ambermorris@berkeley.edu). The projects were completed as part of a graduate-level course, and due to ongoing academic use, they are kept private to prevent access by current students seeking answers. As such, the projects are not publicly accessible on online sources, including GitHub. Please feel free to reach out for further details and to discuss my SAS expertise.

Please contact ambermorris@berkeley.edu with any questions regarding this project.
