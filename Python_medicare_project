This project utilizes Python to conduct in-depth analysis on an abundant and open Medicare data set, readily accessible to the public through the link below.
Data Source: Medicare.gov - The official Medicare website (https://www.medicare.gov/). This esteemed platform provides unfettered access to a diverse range of data sets concerning Medicare beneficiaries, healthcare providers, and services.
This work was an assignment completed through a graduate-level course.


Objectives (using data to answer the following questions):
1. What is the average age of a patient?
2. What is the average age of a non-smoker vs. a smoker?
3. Who pays more for insurance, a non-smoker or a smoker?
4. Which sex has more children?
